# ecommerce-data-analytics-sql-python
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on a large, real-world e-commerce dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights, analyze customer behavior, and evaluate seller and product performance using SQL queries for data manipulation and Python for visualization and further analysis.

Key Objectives
1. Data Preparation and Querying: Utilize MySQL to structure and query the dataset, addressing a range of complexity from basic aggregations to advanced analytical functions.
2. Business Metrics Calculation: Compute core e-commerce metrics including:
    Sales Trends: Calculating monthly order counts and cumulative sales over time.
    Revenue Contribution: Determining the percentage of total revenue generated by each product category.
    Seller Performance: Ranking sellers based on total revenue generated.
    Customer Loyalty: Calculating customer retention rates.
    Growth Analysis: Measuring year-over-year sales growth.
3. Analytical Reporting: Employ Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) within Jupyter Notebooks to process the results and create informative data visualizations.

Project Structure
The analysis is broken down into three main sections based on the complexity of the SQL queries and the insights derived:
  Basic Queries: Focuses on fundamental data retrieval and simple aggregations, such as listing unique customer cities and counting orders in a specific year.
  Intermediate Queries: Deals with more complex aggregations and joins to calculate metrics like average products per order by city and sales percentages per category.
  Advanced Queries: Implements window functions and complex logic to derive sophisticated business intelligence metrics, including moving averages of order values, cumulative sales, and customer retention rate.

Technologies Used
  Database: MySQL
  Query Language: SQL
  Programming Language: Python
  Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
